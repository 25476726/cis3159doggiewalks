        <h1>About Doggie Walks</h1>
        <p>Doggie walks are committed to ensuring that your pet is safe, healthy and active. Our canine friends should
            feel different terrain under their paws, hear different sounds and see different sights and have a decent
            sniff about!</p>
        <img class="aboutimg" src="images/pexels-photo-58997.jpeg" alt="A dog walking next to a lake with its tongue out">
        <p>While dogs need daily exercise in order to stay healthy, for many people it's not always possible to walk
            their pets regularly. That's why we established Doggie Walks, to help people across Lancashire and
            Merseyside ensure their dogs live happy lives.</p> <br>
        <h2>Meet The Doggie Walks Team</h2>
        <p>Meet the doggie walks team! We’re fully trained and insured to work with animals and are committed to the
            health and benefits of your pet. We aim to keep providing the best knowledge regarding dogs as we can, and
            to do this we believe you cannot sit still in this occupation as we learn more about dogs daily. We ensure
            that our knowledge is kept up-to-date by attending regular seminars and courses presented by well-respected
            canine trainers, behaviorists and practitioners.</p>

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>Your dog will be collected from your home and taken to a local park for a walk with their pals. Exercise,
            mental stimulation, socialisation and play make for a happier, calmer and more contented dog. With a
            maximum of 4 dogs per walk you can be sure that your best friend is getting all the attention they deserve.</p>
